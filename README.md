# Application pitch

Nowadays, small businesses and other employers waste a lot of time planning hourly workers who have flexible and varying availability. Many of them still communicate and plan by hand, including salary calculations, presence tracking and more. This all is prone to human errors and is difficult to keep track of.
Agendapp is a time-management and workforce organization app designed to simplify scheduling, presence tracking, and salary calculation for small businesses, part-time workers, and independent contractors. It centralizes planning, communication, and reporting in a single, user-friendly interface, reducing errors and saving time for both employers and employees.
