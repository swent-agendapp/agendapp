# SwEnt M1 Team Grading Report

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

## Implementation (APK, CI, tests)

We looked at whether your APK is functional and reliable. We also assessed your repo setup, whether it is clearly organized and if there is a CI running Sonar Cloud and running tests including at least one meaningful end-to-end test.

- The + button is really hidden, it would be good to make it more visible
- There is no meaningful end-to-end test
- you didnt mention the use of AI

- you could add a review checklist (and you briefly mention about PR but add more infos about the expected PR struture)

- no mention about meetings time

For this part, you received 3.8 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them.
We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

- for tasks with 2 assignees, separate the tasks into 2 sub tasks with each one assignee or at least describe the subtasks in the description (show thow will deal with dependencies)

- some of the tasks has poor description ('add localization feature' for isntance)

- otehrwise you are on a good path !! I


- some fields of some user stories have missing fields (#27)

- you could enhance by displaying the labels of slected user stories in current and next sprint tabs (like they are in the backlog tab)

For this part, you received 4 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma

We evaluated your Figma, whether it is up-to-date with the app and how it is used as a communication, planning and design tool to accelerate the implementation of good UI.

- Some fields are kind of flying on the screen, it would be good to explicitly show what is a "to complete" field
- Calendar is not up to date, it is missing the + button

- your figma is ahead of the app, keep going like this !

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Architecture

We reviewed your projectâ€™s architecture diagram, whether it is up-to-date with the app and if it follows clean design principles. We also looked at how it is used to discuss and document the architecture of the app as the app evolves.

- You need to add subgroups in your architecture diagram

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process Documents

We reviewed your Scrum process documentation, including Sprint Retrospectives and Team Standup. We assessed whether they documented the process in detail, and how they were used to prepare the meetings. We also looked at your ability to lead structured and effective meetings, with everyone's participation.

- You should start to be more independent during meetings, let the SM lead the conversation and moderate the whole meeting

For this part, you received 5.25 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M1 is 4.27. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).
