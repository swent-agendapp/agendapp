# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

- When sharing your location for the map feature, an error occurs and the location is not being fetched. This needs to be addressed to ensure the feature works as expected.

- We noticed a significant number of magic values and hard-coded strings in your code. While you’ve made considerable progress in reducing these, some still remain. Make sure to continue extracting them into separate constants or resource files for better maintainability.

For this part, you received 5.32 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

- The APK is stable, and no crashes have been identified! Great job on ensuring overall stability.

- There is an issue with the GPS feature that needs to be addressed, as it currently prevents location-based functionality from working correctly.

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

- The Figma is up to date, including both mockups and wireframes! Well done.

- The Figma should be ahead of the app development. Make sure to design future features in advance to facilitate smoother implementation.

- The architecture diagram should be updated to include both the local and Firestore repository components for better clarity and completeness.

For this part, you received 4.25 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

- You should provide more detailed documentation for your issues, including technical steps needed to complete the task. This ensures clarity for both yourself and your teammates.

- Some task titles are vague. Make sure to clearly explain what will be done in each task to avoid confusion.

- There are no Product Backlogs for Sprint 6. Please ensure all sprints have a complete backlog.

- We noticed that some normal tasks were incorrectly marked as User Stories (e.g., #206). Make sure to classify tasks correctly.

- Don’t forget to log the actual time spent on your tasks (e.g., #203) to improve tracking and planning.

For this part, you received 4 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

- The team participates actively during meetings. Discussions are engaging and productive, and everyone contributes valuable ideas. This level of collaboration greatly supports project progress and decision-making.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

- During Sprint 4, some of the work completed was partially undone. We understand that midterms had a significant impact on productivity. For future sprints, plan ahead to mitigate such interruptions and maintain steady progress.

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 5.2/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
